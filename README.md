# PLAYPAL - A Games Review and Gamer Connection App


Project Background

This app was created with the objective of using new technologies and frameworks that the team was not exposed to in the Northcoders bootcamp. The team was given 8 days to design and develop a working application using the new technologies/framework chosen by the team.

## Project Description

### Purpose
This project was created to connect video gamers with other video gamers with similar gaming interests.

#### Features
The app allows a user to review a game. Upon submitting a review, the app will suggest other app users with a similar rating to connect with. Once connected, the app allows the user to use the in-app messaging system to directly communicate with the other user. Additionally, the app contains a calendar feature that allows users to make meeting requests and coordinate playing/meet up schedules. 

### Technologies/Frameworks
The app was created using Svelte for the front end, Firebase for a non-relational back end solution and RAWG API [https://rawg.io/] for the gaming information.  TalkJS [https://talkjs.com/] was used for the messaging component and Calendar developed by Vladmir Kurko [https://github.com/vkurko/calendar].

2. Project Description

This is an important component of your project that many new developers often overlook.

Your description is an extremely important aspect of your project. A well-crafted description allows you to show off your work to other developers as well as potential employers.

The quality of a README description often differentiates a good project from a bad project. A good one takes advantage of the opportunity to explain and showcase:

    What your application does,
    Why you used the technologies you used,
    Some of the challenges you faced and features you hope to implement in the future.

3. Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is very long, you might want to add a table of contents to make it easy for users to navigate to different sections easily. It will make it easier for readers to move around the project with ease.
4. How to Install and Run the Project

If you are working on a project that a user needs to install or run locally in a machine like a "POS", you should include the steps required to install your project and also the required dependencies if any.

Provide a step-by-step description of how to get the development environment set and running.
5. How to Use the Project

Provide instructions and examples so users/contributors can use the project. This will make it easy for them in case they encounter a problem â€“ they will always have a place to reference what is expected.

You can also make use of visual aids by including materials like screenshots to show examples of the running project and also the structure and design principles used in your project.

Also if your project will require authentication like passwords or usernames, this is a good section to include the credentials.
6. Include Credits

If you worked on the project as a team or an organization, list your collaborators/team members. You should also include links to their GitHub profiles and social media too.

Also, if you followed tutorials or referenced a certain material that might help the user to build that particular project, include links to those here as well.

This is just a way to show your appreciation and also to help others get a first hand copy of the project.
7. Add a License

For most README files, this is usually considered the last part. It lets other developers know what they can and cannot do with your project.

We have different types of licenses depending on the kind of project you are working on. Depending on the one you will choose it will determine the contributions your project gets.

The most common one is the GPL License which allows other to make modification to your code and use it for commercial purposes. If you need help choosing a license, use check out this link: https://choosealicense.com/

Up to this point what we have covered are the minimum requirements for a good README. But you might also want to consider adding the following sections to make it more eye catching and interactive.
